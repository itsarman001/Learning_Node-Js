## Introduction

### What is Node Js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

It uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable network applications.

It is based on chrome v8 engine.  It convert JavaScript  human readable to machine readable.

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous and non-blocking:** Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, allowing it to handle multiple concurrent requests without blocking the main thread. This makes it highly efficient for handling I/O-bound tasks.
- **Single-threaded:** Node.js runs on a single thread, but it uses the event loop to handle multiple tasks concurrently. This helps to reduce overhead and improve performance.
- **Cross-platform:** Node.js can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Large ecosystem:** Node.js has a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries available through the npm package manager. This makes it easy to build complex applications quickly.
- **Real-time applications:** Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications, such as chat applications, online games, and streaming services.
- **Microservices architecture:** Node.js is often used to build microservices, which are small, independent services that work together to form a larger application.

### Common use cases for Node.js:

- **Web applications:** Node.js can be used to build both front-end and back-end web applications.
- **API development:** Node.js is a popular choice for building RESTful APIs.
- **Real-time applications:** Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications, such as chat applications, online games, and streaming services.
- **Microservices architecture:** Node.js is often used to build microservices, which are small, independent services that work together to form a larger application.
- **IoT applications:** Node.js can be used to build IoT applications that collect and process data from sensors and devices.

### We can run JavaScript on 4 platforms

1. Online Compiler
2. Terminal
    1. Type Node in Terminal and then you can write JavaScript code in terminal
3. Vs Code
    1. to run JavaScript code in vs code type node <file name> in integrated terminal
4. In Browser Console
